# MQTT in C# .NET - M2MQTT C# Example

This repository contains a step-by-step guide and example code showcasing how to use MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) in C# with the M2MQTT library. The tutorial demonstrates registering an application as an MQTT Client, enabling the application to both subscribe to and publish MQTT messages to a specified topic using an MQTT Broker.

## Overview

In the accompanying video tutorial, we explain the step-by-step procedures to set up the application as an MQTT Client using C#. The example code showcased in the video provides a comprehensive demonstration of a C# MQTT Client application using the M2MQTT library.

### Features

- Establishing connection with MQTT Broker
- Subscribing to MQTT topics
- Publishing MQTT messages

## Getting Started

To run the example and understand the MQTT implementation in C#, follow these steps:

1. [Step 1: Get M2MQTT Library](#step-1-get-m2mqtt-library)
2. [Step 2: Establish Connection](#step-2-establish-connection)
3. [Step 3: Subscribe and Publish](#step-3-subscribe-and-publish)

### Step 1: Get M2MQTT Library

Start by obtaining the M2MQTT library. (Add instructions or links here on how to acquire and add the library to your C# project.)

### Step 2: Establish Connection

Follow these steps to establish a connection with the MQTT Broker. (Explain the process of connecting to the broker using M2MQTT.)

### Step 3: Subscribe and Publish

Demonstrate subscribing to MQTT topics and publishing messages. (Provide code snippets or explanations illustrating how to subscribe and publish using M2MQTT.)

## About MQTT

MQTT, an open OASIS and ISO standard (ISO/IEC 20922), is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol facilitating message transport between devices. Typically running over TCP/IP, MQTT can utilize any network protocol that ensures ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections to support its operations.
